## Site 1
- http://twistedtwinsproductions.net/
- I got to this website by clicking the link in the Twitter bio for The Soska Sisters
- When you arrive to the website, you are presented with a video and a background image, both of which being the first things you see. The nagigation menu along the top is a light pink with white text. Drop down menues are in white with red text. All the text is in all capital letters.
- The webiste is easy to navigate and everything in the menu along the top of the website is labelled. When you hover over the 'Projects' heading on the top menu, a drop down menu appears sorting these different projects into Film, Television, and Graphic Novels. As you scroll down the website you are presented with an embedded video from Vimeo and a some information about who this website is for (The Soska Sisters; Canadian writers and directors)
- The navagation menu along the tops is interative and also has links to social media in the top right corner. There are also videos within this website that the user is able to view.
- The website layout is common and each different page on the website shares the same layout- an embedded video or image, along with some informational text under, which I personally find too repeatitive and boring. Although I don't care for the way this website is presented, it is very easy to use.
- I would change the way the grapgics and images are displayed within this website to give the different pages some variety. I would also avoid using an image as the background and opt for a plain colour background so that other media on the page stands out more.
