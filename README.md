## Site 1
- http://twistedtwinsproductions.net/
- I got to this website by clicking the link in the Twitter bio for The Soska Sisters
- When you arrive to the website, you are presented with a video and a background image, both of which being the first things you see. The nagigation menu along the top is a light pink with white text. Drop down menues are in white with red text. All the text is in all capital letters.
- The webiste is easy to navigate and everything in the menu along the top of the website is labelled. When you hover over the 'Projects' heading on the top menu, a drop down menu appears sorting these different projects into Film, Television, and Graphic Novels. As you scroll down the website you are presented with an embedded video from Vimeo and a some information about who this website is for (The Soska Sisters; Canadian writers and directors)
- The navagation menu along the tops is interative and also has links to social media in the top right corner. There are also videos within this website that the user is able to view.
- The website layout is common and each different page on the website shares the same layout- an embedded video or image, along with some informational text under, which I personally find too repeatitive and boring. Although I don't care for the way this website is presented, it is very easy to use.
- I would change the way the grapgics and images are displayed within this website to give the different pages some variety. I would also avoid using an image as the background and opt for a plain colour background so that other media on the page stands out more.

## Site 2
- https://rue-morgue.com/
- I got to this website by going from the 'Press' section from Site #1 and choosing one of the articles to read that the directors were featured in.
- When arriving to this website you are presented with a full screen image and caption for their newest published article. As you scroll down the website features smaller boxes with either images or text excerpts from other articles and features. The entire website sticks with a darker colour scheme, red, black, and white.
- Navigating this website is farily simple. In the top left corner there is a search bar; in the top middle is the magazines logo; and in the top right corner there are links to other sections of their website: home, shop, about, subscribe. On every page of this website, when you reach the bottom you are presented the logo again and additional links to direct you within the website or to other websites that are associated with the magazine, terms and condtions, and contact information.
- Most things on this website are interactive. Images featured open up magazine articles that go with the image. On the About page, there is an embedded Youtube video where the Author of the magazine speaks about where it origionated and what it's all about. Under the video there is text explaining these details as well. From every page, as you scroll down along the right hand side there are icons for social media that stay fixed in place.
- Personally, I like the way this website is layed out as well as the colour choices as they are my favourites- red and black. 
- The thing I would change about this website is how large the text that are links along the bottom and the size of the logo also placed at the bottom. I feel both are too large and they take up a full screen when scrolled right to the bottom.

## Site 3
- http://frightmareinthefalls.com/
- I got to this webiste by clicking the Expo link on Rue Mourge's website, bringing me to a website for a Horror convention hosted in Niagara Falls, ON.
- When you arrive to the home page of the website the conventions logo is in the left corner and the dates  and time of the convention are located in the right as well as the address. The overall apprearance of the website is very simple and not very interesting to look at. All text is in a white text box, text in black. They use the colour read as an accent feature through out the website. Ex. When a persons name or other website is mentioned.
- Under the logo there are clickable links to bring you to other pages within the website. About, News, Guests, Panels and Attractions, Vendors, FAQ, and Contact. With everything being sorted onto these pages it makes navagation very easy.
- Under the dates and address of the convention there is a live countdown clock. It counts down the days, hours, minutes, secions until the convention in 2019. From any page of the website, as you begin scrolling down the page, in the right bottom corner there is an upwards pointing arrow that when pressed, it will bring you back to the top of the page. 
- For me I find this website useful and interesting because it is a convention that I plan on attending and I know that any informtaion I need to know I am able to find it here. As for the appearance, I personally find it boring and simple.
- Something I would change would be I would add another page to this website that features videos and pictures from previous years conventions so that people can get an idea of what to expect and what they might see there in visual form rather than just reading about it.

## Site 4
- http://www.fallsconventions.com/
