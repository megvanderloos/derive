## Site 1
- http://twistedtwinsproductions.net/
- I got to this website by clicking the link in the Twitter bio for The Soska Sisters
- When you arrive to the website, you are presented with a video and a background image, both of which being the first things you see. The nagigation menu along the top is a light pink with white text. Drop down menues are in white with red text. All the text is in all capital letters.
- The webiste is easy to navigate and everything in the menu along the top of the website is labelled. When you hover over the 'Projects' heading on the top menu, a drop down menu appears sorting these different projects into Film, Television, and Graphic Novels. As you scroll down the website you are presented with an embedded video from Vimeo and a some information about who this website is for (The Soska Sisters; Canadian writers and directors)
- The navagation menu along the tops is interative and also has links to social media in the top right corner. There are also videos within this website that the user is able to view.
- The website layout is common and each different page on the website shares the same layout- an embedded video or image, along with some informational text under, which I personally find too repeatitive and boring. Although I don't care for the way this website is presented, it is very easy to use.
- I would change the way the grapgics and images are displayed within this website to give the different pages some variety. I would also avoid using an image as the background and opt for a plain colour background so that other media on the page stands out more.

## Site 2
- https://rue-morgue.com/
- I got to this website by going from the 'Press' section from Site #1 and choosing one of the articles to read that the directors were featured in.
- When arriving to this website you are presented with a full screen image and caption for their newest published article. As you scroll down the website features smaller boxes with either images or text excerpts from other articles and features. The entire website sticks with a darker colour scheme, red, black, and white.
- Navigating this website is farily simple. In the top left corner there is a search bar; in the top middle is the magazines logo; and in the top right corner there are links to other sections of their website: home, shop, about, subscribe. On every page of this website, when you reach the bottom you are presented the logo again and additional links to direct you within the website or to other websites that are associated with the magazine, terms and condtions, and contact information.
- Most things on this website are interactive. Images featured open up magazine articles that go with the image. On the About page, there is an embedded Youtube video where the Author of the magazine speaks about where it origionated and what it's all about. Under the video there is text explaining these details as well. From every page, as you scroll down along the right hand side there are icons for social media that stay fixed in place.
- Personally, I like the way this website is layed out as well as the colour choices as they are my favourites- red and black. 
- The thing I would change about this website is how large the text that are links along the bottom and the size of the logo also placed at the bottom. I feel both are too large and they take up a full screen when scrolled right to the bottom.

## Site 3
- http://frightmareinthefalls.com/
- I got to this webiste by clicking the Expo link on Rue Mourge's website, bringing me to a website for a Horror convention hosted in Niagara Falls, ON.
- When you arrive to the home page of the website the conventions logo is in the left corner and the dates  and time of the convention are located in the right as well as the address. The overall apprearance of the website is very simple and not very interesting to look at. All text is in a white text box, text in black. They use the colour read as an accent feature through out the website. Ex. When a persons name or other website is mentioned.
- Under the logo there are clickable links to bring you to other pages within the website. About, News, Guests, Panels and Attractions, Vendors, FAQ, and Contact. With everything being sorted onto these pages it makes navagation very easy.
- Under the dates and address of the convention there is a live countdown clock. It counts down the days, hours, minutes, secions until the convention in 2019. From any page of the website, as you begin scrolling down the page, in the right bottom corner there is an upwards pointing arrow that when pressed, it will bring you back to the top of the page. 
- For me I find this website useful and interesting because it is a convention that I plan on attending and I know that any informtaion I need to know I am able to find it here. As for the appearance, I personally find it boring and simple.
- Something I would change would be I would add another page to this website that features videos and pictures from previous years conventions so that people can get an idea of what to expect and what they might see there in visual form rather than just reading about it.

## Site 4
- http://www.fallsconventions.com/
- I got to this website from viewing the map that was featured on Site #3, showing the location of where the convention is held.
- This website is very bright and uses a nice colour pallet. When you arrive on the home page the first thing you see is the convention centres logo in the left corner. The majority of the page is an image of the building with a heading overlaying it along with a button to press to bring up a video. Scrolling down this home page you find a little bit of information about the convention centre, upcoming events, and pictures from their Instagram account. So far I would consider this the most modern looking website I have visited on this assignment based on its choice of colours and layout.
- Beginning at the very top of the page, on a very light grey colour there is text in black, all links to different pages; Home, News, Media Room, FAQS, Careers, Sign Up, and a search bar. Although they are small in text size, they are still visable and easy to find right away. Under those, there is another navigation menu, this time in a darker grey with white text in a slightly larger size. Our centre, Niagara Falls, Our Services, Contact. All of these will take you to another page.
- On this website the image you are first presented with also has a video embedded to it when clicked on. On either side of the image there are faint arrows to pointing left and right, when you press on on the the arrows it allows you to view another picture (4 different ones) that is embedded with a link to another page when clicking on the photo. As you begin to scroll down the page a grey bar is fixed in place in the top right as you scroll. The bar has buttons you can press, Find an Event and Book an Event. Also as you begin to scroll in the bottom right corner an upwards pointing arrow appears, that when clicked it will return you to the top of the page. Just above that arrow, there is an icon which I think looks like a brick wall that when pressed brings up a live chat assistant.
- I personally really like this website. It is nicely laid out and has an appealing colour scheme that is consistant throughout the entire website. Navigating the website is easy and everything is labelled. I like how they have their instagram featured on the home page, showing some of their photos from events held at the convention centre, allowing you to see them without actually being on instagrams website or app.
- Something I would change would be that there are a couple different ways on this website to view information on the convention centre (same information, on different pages). I find that to be confusing and repetitive.

## Site 5

- https://www.visitniagaracanada.com/taste/craft-beer/
- I got to this website from the Niagara Falls page from the Scotiabank Convention Centre's website.
- When you arrive on this website the first thing you see if an image of a beer being poured and text in an ugly font that says 'Craft Beer'. Scrolling down, this website gets better and looks nicer. It has a modern feel to it uses a nice teal and white colour pallet. Scrolling down, you are given some infortmation about craft beer brewieries in Niagara as well as photos of each.
- Along the left hand side of this website are differnt options you can click to filter out the resuts of the breweries shown. When you scroll down the website a white menu bar stays fixed at the top with links to other pages and a search bar.
- The filtering of the breweries is interactive and allows you to view in a list or on a map, which is movable. Nearing the bottom of the page, features images from Instagram that people have used the hashtag MyNiagara on- photos of attractions, wineries, and breweries in the region.
- Overall I like this website and the way it is layed out. I really like the teal colours used as well as how the filtering feature works.
- The only thing I would change would be the ugly font on the image you see when you first arrive on the website.
